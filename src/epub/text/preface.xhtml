PREFACE 

My County, it has been proved in the life of 
every man that though his loves are human, 
and therefore changeable, yet in proportion as 
he attaches them to things unchangeable, so 
they mature and broaden. 

On this account, Dear Sussex, are those 
women chiefly dear to men who, as the seasons 
pass, do but continue to be more and more 
themselves, attain balance, and abandon or 
forget vicissitude. And on this account, 
Sussex, does a man love an old house, 
which was his father’s, and on this account 
does a man come to love with all his heart, 
that part of earth which nourished his boy¬ 
hood. For it does not change, or if it changes, 

<span class="page-number" id="page-viii">viii</span>

it changes very little, and he finds in it the 
character of enduring things. 

In this love he remains content until, per¬ 
haps, some sort of warning reaches him, that 
even his own County is approaching its doom. 
Then, believe me, Sussex, he is anxious in a 
very different way; he would, if he could, 
preserve his land in the flesh, and keep it 
there as it is, forever. But since he knows 
he cannot do that, “ at least,” he says, “ I 
will keep her image, and that shall remain.” 
And as a man will paint with a peculiar passion 
a face which he is only permitted to see for a 
little time, so will one passionately set down 
one’s own horizon and one’s fields before they 
are forgotten and have become a different 
thing. Therefore it is that I have put down 
in writing what happened to me now so many 
years ago, when I met first one man and then 
another, and we four bound ourselves together 
and walked through all your land, Sussex, 
from end to end. For many years I have 
meant to write it down and have not; nor 
would I write it down now, or issue this 
book at all, Sussex, did I not know that 

<span class="page-number" id="page-ix">ix</span>

you, who must like all created things decay, 
might with the rest of us be very near your 
ending. For I know very well in my mind 
that a day will come when the holy place 
shall perish and all the people of it and never 
more be what they were. But before that 
day comes, Sussex, may your earth cover me, 
and may some loud-voiced priest from Arundel, 
or Grinstead, or Crawley, or Storrington, but 
best of all from home, have sung Do Mi Fa 
Sol above my bones.
