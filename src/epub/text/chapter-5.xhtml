I woke sharply and suddenly from a dream
in that empty room. It was Grizzlebeard
that had put his hand upon my shoulder.
The late winter dawn was barely glimmer¬
ing, and there was mist upon the heath
outside and rime upon the windows.

<div class="aside">The Place in the Mind</div>

I woke and shuddered. For in my dream
I had come to a good place, the place inside
the mind, which is all made up of remem¬
brance and of peace. Here I had seemed
to be in a high glade of beeches, standing<!--Page 298-->
on soft, sweet grass on a slope very high
above the sea; the air was warm and the
sea was answering the sunlight, very far
below me. It was such a place as my own
Downs have made for me in my mind, but
the Downs transfigured, and the place was
full of glory and of content, height and
great measurement fit for the beatitude of
the soul. Nor had I in that dream any
memory of loss, but rather a complete end
of it, and I was surrounded, though I could
not see them, with the return of all those
things that had ever been my own. But
this was in the dream only; and when I
woke it was to the raw world and the
sad uncertain beginnings of a little winter
day.

<div class="aside">My Companions Rise</div>

Grizzlebeard, who had woken me, said
gravely:

“We must be up early. Let us waken
the others also, and take the road, for we
are near the end of our journey. We have
come to the term and boundary of this
short passage of ours, and of our brief com¬
panionship, for we must reach the County<!--Page 299-->
border in these early hours. So awake, and
waken the others.”

Then I woke the other two, who also
stirred and looked wearily at the thin, grey
light, but rose in their turn, and then I said
to Grizzlebeard:

“Shall we not eat before we start to the
place after which we shall not see each other
any more ? ”

But he said, “No, we have but a little
way to go, and when we have gone that
little way together, we will break a crust
between us, and pledge each other if you
will, and then we shall never see each other
any more.”

The others also said that this was the way
in which the matter should be accomplished.

Yielding to them, therefore (for I perceived
that they were greater than I), we went out
into the morning mist and walked through
it sturdily enough, but silent, the sounds of
our footsteps coming close into our ears,
blanketed and curtained by the fog. For a
mile and second mile and a third no one
of us spoke a word to another. But as I<!--Page 300-->
walked along I looked furtively first to one
side and then to the other, judging my com¬
panions, whom chance had given me for these
few hours; and it seemed to me (whether from
the mist or what not) that they were taller
than men; and their eyes avoided my eyes.

<div class="aside">We Break Bread</div>

When we had come to Treyford, Grizzle-
beard, who was by dumb assent at this
moment our leader, or at any rate certainly
mine, took that lane northward which turns
through Redlands and up to the hill of
Elstead and its inn. Then for the first
time he spoke and said:

“Here we will break a loaf, and pledge
each other for the last time.”

Which we did, all sitting quite silent, and
then again we took the road, and went for¬
ward as we had gone forward before, until
we came to Harting. And when we came
to Harting, just in the village street of it,
Grizzlebeard, going forward a little more
quickly, drew with him his two companions,
and they stood before me, barring the road
as it were, and looking at me kindly, but
halting my advance.<!--Page 301-->

<div class="aside">They Will Not Stay</div>

I said to them, a little afraid, “Do you
make for our parting now? We are not
yet come to the county border!”

But Grizzlebeard said (the others keeping
silent):—

“Yes. As we met upon this side of the
county border, so shall we part before we
cross it. Nor shall you cross it with us.
But these my companions and I, when we
have crossed it must go each to our own
place: but you are perhaps more fortunate,
for you are not far from your home.”

When he had said this, I was confused to
wonder from his voice and from the larger
aspect of himself and his companions, whether
indeed they were men.

“. . . And is there,” I said, “in all the
county another such company of four; shall
I find even one companion like any of you ?
Now who is there to-day that can pour out
songs as you can at every hour and make up
the tunes as well ? And even if they could
so sing, would any such man or men be of one
faith with me ?

“Come back with me,” I said, “along the<!--Page 302-->
crest of the Downs; we will overlook to¬
gether the groves at Lavington and the
steep at Bury Combe, and then we will
turn south and reach a house I know of
upon the shingle, upon the tide, near where
the Roman palaces are drowned beneath the
Owers; and to-night once more, and if you
will for the last time, by another fire we
will sing yet louder songs, and mix them
with the noise of the sea.”

<div class="aside">Nor Linger with Me</div>

But Grizzlebeard would not even linger. He
looked at me with a dreadful solemnity and said:

“No; we are all three called to other
things. But do you go back to your home,
for the journey is done.”

Then he added (but in another voice);
“There is nothing at all that remains: nor
any house; nor any castle, however strong;
nor any love, however tender and sound;
nor any comradeship among men, however
hardy. Nothing remains but the things of
which I will not speak, because we have
spoken enough of them already during these
four days. But I who am old will give you
advice, which is this—to consider chiefly from<!--Page 303-->
now onward those permanent things which
are, as it were, the shores of this age and
the harbours of our glittering and pleasant
but dangerous and wholly changeful sea.”

<div class="aside">For All Things End</div>

When he had said this (by which he meant
Death), the other two, looking sadly at me,
stood silent also for about the time in which
a man can say good-bye with reverence. Then
they all three turned about and went rapidly
and with a purpose up the village street.

I watched them, straining my sad eyes, but
in a moment the mist received them and they
had disappeared.

<hr/>

I went up in gloom, by the nearest spur,
on to the grass and into the loneliness of the
high Downs that are my brothers and my
repose; and, once upon their crest, setting
my face eastward I walked on in a fever for
many hours back towards the places from
which we had come; and below me as I went
was that good landscape in which I had passed
such rare and memorable hours.

<div class="aside">I Follow the Crest of the Downs Alone</div>

I still went on, through little spinnies here
and there, and across the great wave tops and<!--Page 304-->
rolls of the hills, and as the day proceeded
and the light declined about me I still went
on, now dipping into the gaps where tracks
and roads ran over the chain, now passing for
a little space into tall and silent woods wher¬
ever these might stand. And all the while
I came nearer and nearer to an appointed spot
of which a memory had been fixed for years
in my mind. But as I strode, with such a
goal in view, an increasing loneliness oppressed
me, and the air of loss and the echo of those
profound thoughts which had filled the last
words we four had exchanged together.

It was in the grove above Lavington, near
the mounds where they say old kings are
buried, that I, still following the crest of my
hills, felt the full culmination of all the twenty
tides of mutability which had thus run to¬
gether to make a skerry in my soul. I saw
and apprehended, as a man sees or touches a
physical thing, that nothing of our sort
remains, and that even before my county
should cease to be itself I should have left
it. I recognised that I was (and I confessed)
in that attitude of the mind wherein men<!--Page 305-->
admit mortality; something had already
passed from me — I mean that fresh and
vigorous morning of the eyes wherein the
beauty of this land had been reflected as in
a tiny mirror of burnished silver. Youth was
gone out apart; it was loved and regretted,
and therefore no longer possessed.

Then, as I walked through this wood more
slowly, pushing before me great billows of
dead leaves, as the bows of a ship push the
dark water before them, this side and that,
when the wind blows full on the middle of
the sail and the water answers loudly as the
ship sails on, so I went till suddenly I remem¬
bered with the pang that catches men at the
clang of bells what this time was in Novem¬
ber; it was the Day of the Dead. All that
day I had so moved and thought alone and
fasting, and now the light was falling. I had
consumed the day in that deep wandering on
the heights alone, and now it was evening.
Just at that moment of memory I looked up
and saw that I was there. I had come upon
that lawn which I had fixed for all these
hours to be my goal.

<div class="aside">The Evening Gathers Over All the Weald</div>

It is the great platform just over Barl’ton<!--Page 306-->
whence all the world lies out before one. East¬
ward into the night for fifty miles stretched
on the wall of the Downs, and it stretched
westward towards the coloured sky where a
full but transfigured daylight still remained.
Southward was the belt of the sea, very broad,
as it is from these bare heights, and absolutely
still; nor did any animal move in the brush¬
wood near me to insult the majesty of that
silence. Northward before me and far below
swept the Weald.

The haze had gone; the sky was faint and
wintry, but pure throughout its circle, and
above the Channel hung largely the round of
the moon, still pale, because the dark had not
yet come.

But though she had been worshipped so
often upon such evenings and from such a
place, a greater thing now moved and took
me from her, and turning round I looked
north from the ridge of the steep escarpment
over the plain to the rivers and the roofs
of the Weald. I would have blessed them
had I known some form of word or spell which
might convey an active benediction, but as I<!--Page 307-->
knew none such, I repeated instead the list of
their names to serve in place of a prayer.

The river Arun, a valley of sacred water;
and Amberley Wild brook, which is lonely
with reeds at evening; and Burton Great
House, where I had spent nights in November;
and Lavington also and Hidden Byworth;
and Fittleworth next on, and Egdean Side, all
heath and air; and the lake and the pine trees
at the mill; and Petworth, little town.

All the land which is knit in with our flesh,
and yet in which a man cannot find an acre
nor a wall of his own.

I knew as this affection urged me that verse
alone would satisfy something at least of that
irremediable desire. I lay down therefore at
full length upon the short grass which the
sheep also love, and taking out a little stump
of pencil that I had, and tearing off the back
of a letter, I held my words prepared.

<div class="aside">A Piece of Verse Is Written and I Come to My Home</div>

My metre, which at first eluded me (though
it had been with me in a way for many hours)
was given me by these chance lines that came:

<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
	<p>
		<span>“…and therefore even youth that dies</span><br/>
		<span>May leave of right its legacies.”</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>
<!--Page 308-->

I put my pencil upon the paper, doubtfully
and drew little lines, considering my theme.
But I would not long hesitate in this manner,
for I knew that all creation must be chaos
first, and then gestures in the void before it
can cast out the completed thing. So I put
down in fragments this line and that; and
thinking first of how many children below
me upon that large and fruitful floor were
but entering what I must perforce abandon,
I wrote down:

<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
	<p>
		<span>“…and of mine opulence I leave</span><br/>
		<span>To every Sussex girl and boy</span><br/>
		<span>My lot in universal joy.”</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

Having written this down, I knew clearly
what was in my mind.

The way in which our land and we mix up
together and are part of the same thing
sustained me, and led on the separate parts
of my growing poem towards me; introducing
them one by one; till at last I wrote down
this further line:

<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
	<p>
		<span>“One with our random fields we grow.”</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

And since I could not for the moment fill in<!--Page 309-->
the middle of the verse, I wrote the end,
which was already fashioned:

<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
	<p>
		<span>“… because of lineage and because</span><br/>
		<span>The soil and memories out of mind</span><br/>
		<span>Embranch and broaden all mankind.”</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

Ah! but if a man is part of and is rooted
in one steadfast piece of earth, which has
nourished him and given him his being, and
if he can on his side lend it glory and do it
service (I thought), it will be a friend to him
for ever, and he has outflanked Death in a way.

<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
	<!--TODO how to style interruption in verse?-->
	<p>
		<span>“And I shall pass” (thought I), “but this shall stand</span><br/>
		<span>Almost as long as No-Man’s Land.”</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

“No, certainly,” I answered to myself aloud,
“he does not die! ” Then from that phrase
there ran the fugue, and my last stanzas stood
out clear at once, complete and full, and I
wrote them down as rapidly as writing can go.

<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
	<!--TODO how to style interruption in verse?-->
	<p>
		<span>“He does not die” (I wrote) “that can bequeath</span><br/>
		<span>Some influence to the land he knows,</span><br/>
		<span>Or dares, persistent, interwreath</span><br/>
		<span>Love permanent with the wild hedgerows;</span><br/>
		<span class="i1">He does not die, but still remains</span><br/>
		<span class="i1">Substantiate with his darling plains.</span>
	</p>
	<!--Page 310-->
	<p>
		<span>“The spring’s superb adventure calls</span><br/>
		<span>His dust athwart the woods to flame;</span><br/>
		<span>His boundary river’s secret falls</span><br/>
		<span>Perpetuate and repeat his name.</span><br/>
		<span class="i1">He rides his loud October sky:</span><br/>
		<span class="i1">He does not die. He does not die.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>“The beeches know the accustomed head</span><br/>
		<span>Which loved them, and a peopled air</span><br/>
		<span>Beneath their benediction spread</span><br/>
		<span>Comforts the silence everywhere;</span><br/>
		<span class="i1">For native ghosts return and these</span><br/>
		<span class="i1">Perfect the mystery in the trees.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>“So, therefore, though myself be crosst</span><br/>
		<span>The shuddering of that dreadful day</span><br/>
		<span>When friend and fire and home are lost</span><br/>
		<span>And even children drawn away—</span><br/>
		<span class="i1">The passer-by shall hear me still,</span><br/>
		<span class="i1">A boy that sings on Duncton Hill.”</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

Full of these thoughts and greatly relieved
by their metrical expression, I went, through
the gathering darkness, southward across the
Downs to my home.
